# Chick-Fil-A Meal Component Segmentation

## Problem Statement

This project implements fine-grained semantic segmentation for precise identification of Chick-Fil-A meal components. Utilizing transfer learning techniques with Open-MMLab's MMSegmentation framework, we develop a custom-tailored model capable of accurately delineating individual food items—specifically sandwiches, fries, and drinks—within composite meals.

## Methodology

The methodology encompasses:

- Data collection
- Annotation
- Model selection
- Optimization

## Goals

The segmentation capability enables potential downstream applications including:

- Automated calorie estimation
- Portion control analysis
- Nutritional tracking systems

These applications could benefit both consumers and the food service industry in making more informed dietary decisions.
